				<h2>My Intrest</h2>
				<p>My main drive for studying engineering is because it's a good way to challange and pratice my skills, and I enjoy solving practical problems with my skills and creativity. I 
				plan on furthering my skills by studying at Exeter and my practical projects.</p>
				<h2>My Course</h2>
				<p>I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering (bENG) with a year in industry at exeter university. Comming september I shall enter my second year. I am not completely decided if
				I want to go straight into work after that or continue down the academic route</p>
				<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
				<p>I am a firm believer in learning by doing, so I ensure I always challenge myself by solving problems, making things or just experementing with new ideas or tools. It's by these
				 projects I can gain practical experience and familiarity with many subjects that might not be covered by an academic education.</p>
				<h3>RC systems</h3>
				<p>My main project
				is the RC systems. This is my main project, where I iterate design after design for an RC vehicle. It has currently undegone three iterations, with a fourth currently being worked on!
				With each iteration, I talk about the new ideas I implemented, any challenges I faced and suggested improvements to newer versions. It has gone from a simple rig made of foam and balsa
				wood, to now where I am looking at compact gearing, standardised parts, multi-material chassis and impact simulation.</p>
				<h3><a href="3D printer.html">3D printing</a></h3>
				<p>I purchased an ender 5 pro many years ago. Nowadays 3D printers are moving to plug-and-play sort of expertiese required for them to function. They have AI detection, smart sensors
				and high-power processing units to do alot of the heavy-lifitng for you. Back then (and this is still true now for many mordern printers) you can't just plug it into an electrical
				outlet, throw in a 3D model and hit start. No, it came in a box you had to assemble, then you have to calibrate in, load in the correct settings manualy for the type of filament you
				were using then had to carefully tune the slicer to not damage or jam the printer. There is of course more to this than the short list given, and I lay it all out in the
				<a href="3D printer.html">3D printing</a> page.</p>
				<h3><a href="Rocket Analysis.html">Rocket Analysis</a></h3>
				<p>Rocket Analysis is an intresting one. I enjoy space simulator games, and while all of my other pratical projects are physical, practical things, I decided to try my hand at some
				theory and simulation. Using a simple simulator and a few trips to wikipedia I manage to simulate and predict the capabilites of different rockets, along with reversing this process
				in order to calculate the perfect rocket for a certain situation. This starts small, from simply reaching a certain speed while keeping the mass of the rocket small, to a full 1:1
				scale recreation of the moon landing, with a custom made rocket made with this predictive model.</p>
