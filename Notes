				 <h2>Chapter -: Stages</h2>
				 <p>Actual rockets are not massive blocks of fuel, attached to an absurd amount of engines. Take the saturn V for example (<i>fig22</i>). The saturn V was basicaly a massive stack of a rocket ontop of another
				 rockets ontop of another and so and so. This makes sense when you consider the graph of engines to fuel tanks (<i>fig10.</i>). As you can see, the "layers" get thicker, this is because of the immense increace in
				  fuel needed. Why is this the case? Well, as fuel is burned, the tank it was stored in gets left behind. This is effectively dead weight, and serves no purpose other than to make it harder for the craft to move,
				  hence increacing the demand for fuel. We can fix that by adding stages. However, stages themselves have weight, so adding too many will bog down the rocket unnecisaraly. This however is not </p>
